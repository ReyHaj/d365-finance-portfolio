# Project 02 – Customer Payments & Settlement  
**Detailed Step-by-Step Documentation**

This document explains, step by step, how customer payments are recorded, posted, settled, and analysed for **Customer P01-0001 – Project01 Test Customer**.

> Prerequisite: Project 01 has already created and posted:
> - Free Text Invoice: **FTI-00000020** – 262.50 USD  
> - Sales Order Invoice: **CIV-00000715** – 480.00 USD  

---

## Phase 0 – Starting Point: Open AR Invoices

**Navigation**

> Accounts receivable > Customers > All customers >  
> Open **P01-0001** > Click **Transactions**

**What to verify**

- You should see at least two **open** transactions:
  - Transaction type: **Customer** – Invoice `FTI-00000020` – Amount 262.50 – Balance 262.50  
  - Transaction type: **Sales order** – Invoice `CIV-00000715` – Amount 480.00 – Balance 480.00
- Both balances are **greater than 0** → customer owes the company.

## Phase 1 – Create Customer Payment Journal

### 1.1 Open the Customer payment journal list

**Navigation**

> Accounts receivable > Payments > Customer payments > Customer payment journal

Here you see a list of previous journals (journal name `CustPay` in your environment).

### 1.2 Create a new journal header

- Click **New**
- Fields:
  - **Name**: `CustPay`  
  - **Description**: `Project 02 – Customer Payments`
- Click **Save**
- Click **Lines** to enter payment lines.

## Phase 2 – Enter Payment Lines (Two Separate Payments)

In this project, we simulate **two separate bank receipts**:

1. One for the Sales Order invoice (480.00)  
2. One for the Free Text invoice (262.50)

### 2.1 Payment line for Sales Order invoice (480.00)

On the **Lines** page:

- **Account type**: `Customer`
- **Account**: `P01-0001`
- **Date**: choose payment date (e.g. 11/25/2025)
- **Description**: `Payment for invoice CIV-00000715`
- **Offset account type**: `Bank`
- **Offset account**: e.g. `USMF OPER` (Bank account in USMF)
- **Currency**: `USD`
- **Credit**: `480.00`
- **Debit**: `0.00`
- **Method of payment**: `CHECK` (or any valid method)

> Consultant logic:  
> - Customer is **credit** because we **reduce** Accounts Receivable.  
> - Bank is **debit** because company cash **increases**.

Later we will use **Settle transactions** so that this payment closes invoice `CIV-00000715`.

### 2.2 Payment line for Free Text invoice (262.50)

Add a **second line**:

- **Account type**: `Customer`
- **Account**: `P01-0001`
- **Date**: same or different date
- **Description**: `Payment for invoice FTI-00000020`
- **Credit**: `262.50`
- Other fields similar to the first line.

- `Phase02_JournalLine_Posting/03_FTI_PaymentLine.png`

### 2.3 Validate and Post

- Click **Validate > Validate** to check for configuration errors.  
- If no errors appear, click **Post > Post**.

Result:

- A **voucher** is posted for each payment line.
- Customer transaction list now includes **two payment transactions** (`ARPM...` style vouchers).

---

## Phase 3 – Settlement (Apply Payments to Invoices)

The journal posted payments to AR and Bank, but **settlement** connects each payment to a specific invoice.

We will perform **full settlement**:

- Payment 480.00 → Sales invoice 480.00  
- Payment 262.50 → FTI invoice 262.50

### 3.1 Settlement for Free Text invoice

**Navigation**

> Accounts receivable > Customers > All customers >  
> Customer **P01-0001** > **Transactions**

1. Select the **payment transaction** related to `FTI-00000020`
   - Transaction type: **Payment**
   - Amount: –262.50
2. Click **Settlement > Settle transactions**

In the **Settle transactions** form:

- Find invoice `FTI-00000020`  
- Mark the checkbox in the **Mark** column.
- Confirm that the **Amount to settle** equals `262.50`.
- Click **OK**.

Result:

- Payment and invoice are now **settled**.
- Balance for the invoice becomes **0.00**.
- The **Last settlement** date is populated.
- A **settlement record** exists under **View settlements**:

  - Document type: Payment vs Customer  
  - Amount settled in transaction currency: 262.50  
  - Balance: 0.00

### 3.2 Settlement for Sales Order invoice

Repeat the same steps but choose the **480.00** payment and invoice `CIV-00000715`:

- In **Settle transactions**, mark invoice `CIV...`
- Confirm full settlement `480.00`
- Click **OK**

Result:

- Sales order invoice becomes **closed**.
- Payment `ARPM...` shows as settled.
- **View settlements** shows linkage between payment and invoice.

## Phase 4 – Voucher & Ledger Analysis

Now we analyse the **ledger impact** of customer payments.

### 4.1 Open voucher from payment transaction

From **Customer transactions** for P01-0001:

1. Select the **payment** transaction (e.g. `ARPM000910` or `ARPM000911`).
2. Click **Voucher**.

You will see two lines per payment:

Example for payment 480.00 (Sales Order):

| Ledger account | Account name          | Debit  | Credit | Posting type        |
|----------------|----------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| 110110-001     | Bank Account – USD   | 480.00 | 0.00   | Bank                |
| 130100-…       | Accounts Receivable  | 0.00   | 480.00 | Customer balance    |

Example for payment 262.50 (Free Text):

| Ledger account | Account name          | Debit  | Credit | Posting type        |
|----------------|----------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| 110110-001     | Bank Account – USD   | 262.50 | 0.00   | Bank                |
| 130100-…       | Accounts Receivable  | 0.00   | 262.50 | Customer balance    |

**Consultant explanation**

- When we posted the invoice (Project 01):

  - DR Accounts Receivable / CR Revenue (+ CR Tax, etc.)

- When we post the payment:

  - DR Bank / CR Accounts Receivable

- After both sides are posted and **settled**, the net effect on AR is **zero**:

  - AR Debit (from invoice) – AR Credit (from payment) = 0  
  - This is visible in **Customer transactions** → Balance 0 and Invoice status Closed.

## Phase 5 – AR Reporting (Customer Aging Report)

### 5.1 Run the Customer aging report

**Navigation**

> Accounts receivable > Inquiries and reports > Customers >  
> **Customer aging report**

This opens the **Customer aging report** dialog.

Key parameters (example):

- **Aging as of**: today’s date (e.g. 11/21/2025)
- **Criteria**: `Due date` (common option)
- **Aging period definition**: e.g. `30_60_90_180`
- **Currency for aging**: `Accounting currency`
- Other options: keep default

Click **OK** to generate the report.

### 5.2 Interpret the report

- Before payments: customer P01-0001 would appear with amounts in the aging buckets (current / 30 days, etc.).  
- After payments and settlement:
  - P01-0001 should have **no open balance**.  
  - Therefore, the customer **does not appear** or appears with **0** in all columns.

Screenshot suggestions:

- `Phase05_AgingReport/01_AgingReport_AllCustomers.png`

**Functional meaning**

- The aging report shows **outstanding AR** only.
- Once an invoice is **fully paid and settled**, it drops out of aging.
- This is a key control report for **collections, credit control, and cash flow forecasting**.

## Concept Summary – What We Did and Why

1. **Invoices (from Project 01)** created **AR balances** for customer P01-0001.  
2. In **Project 02**, we:
   - Recorded **two customer payments** in a **Customer payment journal**.  
   - Posted them, creating **Bank debit / AR credit** entries.  
   - Performed **settlement**, linking each payment to its invoice.  
   - Verified that **customer balance is zero**.  
   - Analysed **voucher postings** to understand GL impact.  
   - Confirmed through **Customer aging report** that there are no open receivables.

## MB-310 & Consultant Notes

- Customer payment journals are part of **Order-to-Cash (O2C)** end-to-end.  
- Key configuration that a consultant must know:
  - Journal name (e.g. `CustPay`)  
  - Offset account type and bank account  
  - Method of payment  
  - Settlement rules (automatic vs manual)  
- For the exam and real projects, you must:
  - Understand the **difference between posting a payment** and **settling** it.  
  - Be able to **navigate from customer → transactions → settlement → voucher**.  
  - Explain the **accounting effect** in simple debit/credit language.  
  - Use AR reports (aging, customer balance) to validate end results.

## Next Steps / Possible Extensions

Future enhancements to this project:

- Partial payments and **remaining balance** scenarios  
- **Cash discounts** and **write-off** of small differences  
- **Prepayments / deposits** (customer pays before invoice)  
- Returned payments / bounced checks  
- Integration with **Bank reconciliation** and **Cash & Bank Management**

This completes **Project 02 – Customer Payments & Settlement**.
