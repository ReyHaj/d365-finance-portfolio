**PROJECT 02 — ACCOUNTS PAYABLE (AP) END-TO-END

DYNAMICS 365 FINANCE – P2P CYCLE**

 *** Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete Accounts Payable (AP) cycle in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, covering the full Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process.

This is Project #02 of my D365 Finance Portfolio, following:

Project 01 – AR Free Text & Sales Order Invoice

Project 01.1 – Customer Payments & Settlement (AR)

Together, they form a full-cycle Finance workflow across AR + AP.

 ***  Project Goal

The objective of this project is to:

Understand the complete AP lifecycle in D365 Finance

Configure vendors, payment terms, methods, posting profiles

Execute the full Procure-to-Pay (P2P) scenario

Analyze the accounting entries (subledger + general ledger)

 ***  Business Scenario – Procure-to-Pay (P2P)

The company needs to purchase raw materials from a supplier (ABC Supplier) and go through:

Vendor setup
Purchase order creation
Receiving the goods
Vendor invoice
Vendor payment

This project simulates a realistic procurement workflow used by Finance teams worldwide.

 ***  Phase 1 — AP Fundamentals (Concepts)
✔ What is Accounts Payable (AP)?
    AP represents liabilities the company owes to suppliers for goods or services received.

✔ Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Stages
    Purchase order
    Product receipt
    Vendor invoice
    Payment
    GL posting

✔ 3-Way Matching
    Quantity match (PO vs Receipt)
    Price match (PO vs Invoice)
    Receipt match (Receipt vs Invoice)

✔ AP vs AR
    Accounts Payable	Accounts Receivable
    Money going out	Money coming in
    Vendor invoices	Customer invoices
    Liability account	Asset account
