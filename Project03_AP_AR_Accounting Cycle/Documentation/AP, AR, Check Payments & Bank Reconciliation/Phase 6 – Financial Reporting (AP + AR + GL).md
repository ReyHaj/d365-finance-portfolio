Phase 6 – Financial Reporting (AP + AR + GL)
*** Purpose of Phase 6 (WHY)

    Up to this point in the project, we executed multiple operational transactions, including:
    Vendor invoices and payments (AP)
    Customer invoices and settlements (AR)
    Bank postings
    Inventory movements
    However, executing transactions alone is not enough in a real finance environment.

The key business question is:

    Are all operational transactions correctly reflected in financial reports and the General Ledger?
    Phase 6 exists to answer this question.

Main objectives of Phase 6:

    Validate financial data accuracy after AP and AR cycles
    Ensure consistency between subledgers (AP / AR) and General Ledger (GL)
    Prepare reliable financial data for:

Trial Balance (Phase 7)
Inventory Value Reconciliation (Phase 8)
Cash Flow Analysis (Phase 9)

*** Phase 6 acts as the bridge between operations and financial reporting.

* Core Concept (Simple Explanation)
  
      AP and AR are where transactions are created
      GL is where the company’s financial reality is reported
      If AP / AR do not reconcile with GL → financial reports are unreliable

Phase 6 verifies that:
What happened operationally is exactly what appears in financial reporting.

** Scope of Phase 6
Phase 6 focuses on validating three major reporting areas:

1️⃣ Accounts Payable Reporting (AP)

    Vendor balances
    Vendor transactions (Invoices & Payments)
    Impact of AP transactions on liabilities

2️⃣ Accounts Receivable Reporting (AR)

    Customer balances
    Customer transactions (Invoices & Payments)
    Impact of AR transactions on receivables

3️⃣ General Ledger Visibility (GL)

    Correct posting of AP and AR transactions into GL
    Subledger-to-ledger integrity

** Activities Performed (HOW)
🔹 1. Vendor Balance Review (Accounts Payable)

    Navigation: Accounts payable > Vendors > All vendors > Transactions
    What was verified:
    Vendor invoice is correctly posted
    Vendor payment is registered
    Invoice and payment are settled correctly
    Vendor balance reflects the expected amount (zero or remaining open balance)
    
    Why this matters:
    Vendor balances directly affect:
    AP Aging reports
    Cash flow forecasts
    Liability reporting

🔹 2. Customer Balance Review (Accounts Receivable)

    Navigation: Accounts receivable > Customers > All customers > Transactions
    What was verified:
    Customer invoice is posted
    Customer payment is recorded
    Settlement is completed
    Customer balance is updated correctly
    
    Why this matters:
    AR represents future cash inflows
    Incorrect AR data leads to incorrect liquidity analysis

🔹 3. AP & AR Aging Reports

    Navigation:
    AP Aging: Accounts payable > Inquiries > Vendor aging
    AR Aging: Accounts receivable > Inquiries > Customer aging
    
    What was analyzed:
    Open balances
    Overdue amounts
    Aging distribution by due date
    
    Why this matters:
    Aging reports identify:
    Cash collection issues
    Payment delays
    Liquidity risk
    These reports are direct inputs for Cash Flow Analysis (Phase 9)

🔹 4. Subledger to General Ledger Validation

    Navigation:General ledger > Inquiries > Voucher transactions
    What was verified:
    Vouchers generated by:
    Vendor invoices
    Vendor payments
    Customer invoices
    Customer payments
    Correct debit and credit postings
    Correct main accounts used
    
    Why this matters:
    Confirms that AP and AR transactions are properly reflected in GL
    Provides the foundation for Trial Balance accuracy

*** Outputs of Phase 6 (RESULTS)

    After completing Phase 6, the following outcomes were achieved:
     - Vendor balances are accurate
     - Customer balances are accurate
     - AP and AR aging reports are consistent
     - Voucher postings are correct
     - General Ledger is ready for Trial Balance

*** Without Phase 6:

    Trial Balance would not be reliable
    Inventory reconciliation would be incomplete
    Cash Flow analysis would be misleading

## Phase 6 – Financial Reporting (AP + AR + GL)
    In this phase, financial reports were validated after completing
    the Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable cycles.
    The objective was to ensure that all operational transactions
    were accurately reflected in financial reports and the General Ledger.

Activities performed:

    - Reviewed vendor balances and AP transactions
    - Reviewed customer balances and AR transactions
    - Analyzed AP and AR aging reports
    - Traced subledger transactions to general ledger vouchers

Outcome:

    - Verified subledger-to-ledger consistency
    - Confirmed accuracy of financial data
    - Prepared the system for trial balance, inventory reconciliation, and cash flow analysis
