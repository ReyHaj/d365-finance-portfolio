*** Phase 7 – Trial Balance (General Ledger Validation)
** Purpose of Phase 7 (WHY)

    After completing:
      Accounts Payable (AP)
      Accounts Receivable (AR)
      Bank transactions
      Inventory postings
    
   the next critical question is:
   
        Is the General Ledger mathematically balanced and financially reliable?
        Phase 7 exists to validate the integrity of the General Ledger.
        While Phase 6 verifies correct posting,
        Phase 7 verifies accounting correctness at ledger level.

Main objectives of Phase 7:

    Confirm that total debits equal total credits
    Validate that all financial postings are correctly summarized
    Ensure readiness for:
      Financial statements
      Cash flow analysis
      Management reporting
      Audit and controls

*** Phase 7 is the accounting checkpoint of the entire system.

** Core Concept (Simple Explanation)
A Trial Balance is a summary of all General Ledger accounts showing:

    Opening balance
    Debit movements
    Credit movements
    Closing balance
    If:
    Total Debit = Total Credit
    then the ledger is balanced and mathematically correct.

Phase 7 confirms that all operational transactions posted earlier resulted in a balanced ledger.
** Scope of Phase 7
Phase 7 focuses exclusively on General Ledger validation, including:

    Main account balances
    Debit and credit totals
    Cross-module posting effects (AP, AR, Inventory, Bank)
    Posting layer accuracy

🧩 Activities Performed (HOW)
🔹 1. Generate Trial Balance

    Navigation: General ledger > Inquiries and reports > Trial balance
    Parameters used:
    From date / To date: Selected fiscal period
    Posting layer: All (or Operations, depending on configuration)
    Financial dimension set: Main account
    Why this is important:
    Different posting layers may contain different transactions
    Selecting the correct layer ensures visibility of all financial postings

🔹 2. Validate Ledger Balance

    What was verified:
    Debit total equals Credit total
    Closing balance is zero (balanced)
    No unexpected discrepancies
    Why this matters:
    Any imbalance indicates posting or configuration errors
    A balanced Trial Balance is mandatory before financial reporting

🔹 3. Review Key Account Balances

    Accounts reviewed:
    Bank accounts
    Accounts Receivable
    Accounts Payable
    Inventory accounts
    Revenue accounts
    Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
    Why this matters:
    Confirms correct financial impact of operational cycles
    Validates cross-module accounting logic

🔹 4. Drill Down to Voucher Transactions

    Navigation: Trial balance > Voucher transactions
    What was reviewed:
    Source of each posting
    Debit and credit logic
    Module origin (AP, AR, Inventory, Bank)
    Why this matters:
    Ensures traceability from financial summary back to transactions
    Supports audit and compliance requirements

** Outputs of Phase 7 (RESULTS)

    After completing Phase 7, the following outcomes were achieved:
    ✅ General Ledger is balanced
    ✅ Debit totals equal Credit totals
    ✅ All AP, AR, Inventory, and Bank postings are reflected
    ✅ Ledger is ready for financial statements
    ✅ Financial data is audit-ready

** Without Phase 7:

    Financial statements cannot be trusted
    Cash flow analysis may be misleading
    Audit and compliance checks would fail
    
  In this phase, the General Ledger was validated using the Trial Balance to ensure accounting integrity after completing operational transactions.

Activities performed:

    - Generated trial balance for the selected fiscal period
    - Verified debit and credit equality
    - Reviewed key account balances (Bank, AP, AR, Inventory, Revenue)
    - Drilled down from trial balance to voucher transactions

Outcome:

    - Confirmed a balanced General Ledger
    - Validated accuracy of financial postings
    - Prepared the system for inventory reconciliation and cash flow analysis
