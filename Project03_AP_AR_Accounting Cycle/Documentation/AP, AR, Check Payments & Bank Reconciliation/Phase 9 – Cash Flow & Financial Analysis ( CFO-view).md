🎯 Purpose of Phase 9 (WHY)

After completing all operational and accounting processes, Phase 9 answers the final and most critical business question:

    How do operational transactions (AP, AR, Bank) affect liquidity, cash position, and financial decision-making?

Phase 9 connects:

    Transaction execution
    Accounting postings
    Bank reconciliation
    Cash forecasting
    CFO-level financial analysis

*** Phase 9 transforms accounting data into cash intelligence.

* Core Concept (High-Level)

      AP & AR generate obligations and receivables
      Payments move cash
      Bank reconciliation validates reality
      Trial Balance confirms accounting integrity
      Cash Flow Forecast shows future liquidity

Phase 9 verifies that all these layers are aligned.
